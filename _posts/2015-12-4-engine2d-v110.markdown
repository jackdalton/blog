With [v1.1.0](https://github.com/jackdalton/engine2d/releases/tag/v1.1.0) comes a fairly large update.

I added an extension registrar, which allows for extensions to have versions and names. These versions and names are logged to the console on each of their initializations.

Thankfully, this update doesn't effect existing extensions since previous extensions were, essentially, made behind Engine2D's back. We used to just declare a prototype of existing constructors, define new constructors, etc.

This update pretty much makes Engine2D aware of extensions.
