With this update, I added some more setters to the `Engine2D.Vector2` class: `Vector2.setX`, and `Vector2.setY`.

I figured the old way would get annoying when you're only changing one axis.

For example:

```javascript
var pos = new Engine2D.Vector2(0, 0);
pos.setPos(new Vector2(1, 0));
```

Now, we can do:

```javascript
var pos = new Engine2D.Vector2(0, 0);
pos.setX(1);
```
