    <p>Over the course of the past couple of weeks I’ve been doing a lot of work on my <a href="https://github.com/jackdalton/engine2d">Engine2D</a> game engine. Everything had been going pretty well.</p>

<p>I was quite satisfied with how easy it is to write extensions, like a <a href="https://github.com/jackdalton/engine2d/blob/master/extensions/engine2d.deltatime.js">time delta extension</a>, or a <a href="https://github.com/jackdalton/engine2d/blob/master/extensions/engine2d.sound.js">sound player extension</a>.</p>

<p>When I started work on this, I had planned to just make the bare minimum, not forcing the user to use canvas rendering, or WebGL. I figured people could write their own extensions, and just share them with others.</p>

<p>But, I’ve run in to a bit of a problem: <strong>How can extensions be aware of each other</strong>?</p>

<p>After some consideration, I’ve realized that an extension which would add a new object type would need to be recognized by, for example, another object type extension.</p>

<p>If both extensions registered as <code>Engine2D.TYPE.TRIANGLE</code>, we’d have a bit of a problem.</p>

<p>This issue has really derailed Engine2D’s extension development.</p>

<p>I had a sprite extension in the works, but until I sort this out it’s not getting anywhere.</p>
